----------------------------------------

This is where I started refactoring `execute()` to put into
`aggregates.people`. Once finished, pulled it out again,
put it back again, diffed and tried to merge, then returned
to the original refactor. It was an orgy of second-thoughts.
It may be prudent to remember where it all started should
I change my mind again after some time.
